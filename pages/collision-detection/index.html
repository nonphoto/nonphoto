	<h1 class="project-title title">Collision Detection</h1>
	<p class="project-description">
		is a common problem in game development, but it has many solutions. In the 2D realm your options can lie anywhere between dead-simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile-based_video_game">tile-based detection</a> to all-purpose <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D">physics libraries</a>. However, I noticed that there were few solutions that handled slopes, gravity, and friction as well as a physics library, but were still relatively light-weight. Since I was planning on making a 2D platformer with a level-editor in Lua and <a href="https://love2d.org">L&ouml;ve</a>, I took this as an opportunity to roll my own.

		I tried to think about the problem in a novel way. Instead of detecting collisions between arbitrary shapes, I only check rectangles against lines. This is a nice abstraction because most game entities are roughly rectangle-shaped, and most game levels can be reduced to a collection of lines that define the boundaries of solid walls. Since you can construct just about any shape by drawing lines end to end, this system offers a lot of freedom when designing levels.

		I give the player-entity inertia by doing some light physics simulation using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration">verlet integration</a>. If the entity intersects with a line, the line moves the entity back outside the line in the direction of the line's normal. This is similar to the system used in one of my favorite 2D games, <a href="http://www.thewayoftheninja.org/nv2.html">N</a>, except their system checks against tiles, not lines.

	<p class="project-description">
		The collision only occurs in one direction, so if the entity intersects a line from below, it is not affected. This makes it easy to create one-way platforms.

	<p class="project-description">
		You can also draw new lines in real-time! Notice also that the entity will slide down slopes because diagonal lines will push the entity sideways as gravity pulls it downward.

	<p class="project-description">
		You can edit existing lines by dragging the ends. The ends snap to each other so there's no gap or overlap.

		I implemented line deletion by checking for intersections with another rectangle. The Lua <a href="https://github.com/nonphoto/denizen/blob/master/terrain.lua">source code</a> is available, but it's undocumented, so it might be more helpful to check out the <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/technique/tutorialA.html">N collision tutorials</a> if you're still curious.
