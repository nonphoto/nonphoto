# Retaining Wall Memory
This series of images began as a set of 300 or so photographs that I took several years ago over a six month period. After going back to them recently I was struck by how different they were from my experience, yet only in the smallest of details. The result is somewhere in between the visual fidelity of the photographs and the abstraction of my own memory, crystalized into a handful of images that best conveyed the visual impact that I remembered.

I often take a design oriented approach in my larger studio projects, and this one is no different. Details of media and composition are carefully chosen to convey the same feeling in the images as they have in my imagination. For example, the charcoal in image 4 is used to give the scene a hazyness that pushes darkness into the foreground, and image 1 uses near-parallel lines to create perspective and depth despite the lack of recognizable forms.
