  H&oslash;jbro Plads is a public square in the center of Copenhagen, Denmark. Flanked on one side by Str&oslash;get, the famous pedestrian-only shopping street, and Christiansborg Palace on the other, the square is often serves as nothing more than a sidewalk. The final project for my architectural design studio course in Denmark was an effort to engage this space more with the major attractions it is surrounded by.

  The pavilion had a closed volume limit of 4 meters on each side, though it was free to expand past that limit when open as long as the expansion could reasonably be operated by two people. Secondarily, the pavilion would be used to promote danish design and local wood construction techniques, being constructed entirely from wood and providing an interior gallery space when open and storage space when closed.

  The design is a modular system. The main stucture is a box with two missing walls and cantilevered ceiling that fits entirely within the volume limit. Built from recycled plywood, this provides just enough sheltered interior space for a gallery while still being structurally sound enough to be transported by a flatbed truck. In addition to the main structure, there are 36 additional plywood benches. Each bench can be constructed by a single person from a single standard-sized sheet of plywood using a system of geometric measurements, which makes each unit easily replaced, waste-free, portable, and interesting to look at. In the pavilion's closed state, these benches stack to form the missing walls of the container and can be locked together to secure interior of the pavilion. When unlocked, the benches can be moved around the square and Str&oslash;et as needed, stacked like lego bricks, or used for seating outside the numerous cafes and shops around the square.
