Peck is a mobile application that facilitates event creation and discovery on college campuses. I worked as both a graphic designer and interface designer for the company, and developed a significant portion of the iOS application as well. Unfortunately, Peck is no longer being supported.

Graphically, the company wanted to portray the app as lightweight, energetic, and slightly humorous but not childish. Bright colors, high contrast, and a contemporary geometric sans-serif are the foundations of the aesthetic. Photographs have a parallax effect to imply depth. The feather logo is an abstraction of the application's original woodpecker mascot.

The application itself consists of several parts:
- A home page that displays a timeline of upcoming events that the user has chosen to attend, as well as suggested events from groups that the user has subscribed to.
- A "Pecks" tab that displays a list of notifications including messages from other users, invitations, and campus wide alerts
- An "Explore" tab that suggests events that the user might be interested in based on events they attended in the past, the user's group connections, and the event's popularity.
- "Post" tab for creating events. The user can choose what group they are representing by creating the event, and a selection of privacy and visibility options that determine who can see the event and who it gets suggested to.
- "Circles" tab for managing the groups the user is a part of. Each group has its own chat thread and the ability to nominate admins to manage the group's settings.
- A "Profile" tab for editing the user's profile settings.

After navigating to one of the tabs, tapping the active tab a second time will send the user back to the home page. The events themselves appear either in a card-like format (as seen in the Explore tab), or as a separate pop-up context when viewed from the timeline, messages, or invitations. Each event also carries its own comment thread, displays who is publicly attending, and has the ability to be shared or flagged as inappropriate.

The result is a vast improvement over the original prototype, which used a single hamburger menu as a catch-all location for every feature rather than separating the application into contexts with a distinct purpose. Categorizing the function of the application in this way streamlines the user experience despite the complexity of the application's feature set.
