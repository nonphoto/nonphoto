I designed this series of posters for the 2016 Senior Art Show at Williams College. Yes, the show is officially titled "Seen Yr Show", and the name even appears in the [local newspaper]({{ site.url }}/assets/{{ page.slug }}/newspaper.pdf). Our class had a very wide range of styles, as well as a desire to face the tradition of the Senior Show with a tongue in the cheek. I tried to capture the irreverent quality of our collective oeuvre in fourteen different neon-colored drawings over an extremely plain poster. Everyone made one drawing in under thirty seconds with their off hand, which I incorporated into the poster individually.

A special thanks for Clover Powell, who helped with the design. The show was up in the Williams College Museum of Art between May 13 and June 5 of 2016. I wrote about my piece in [this post]({% post_url 2016-06-01-narrow-focus %}).
