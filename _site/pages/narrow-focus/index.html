	Being a small town in the north-east, Williamstown is surrounded by 20th century industrial buildings that mostly go unnoticed by everyone who lives there, even more so in the colder months. Either they're in slow motion, or the whole college is in fast-forward.

	The piece is a greyscale print of a computer generated digital image. The program takes a set of drawings, cuts them into vertical slices, and layers the slices on top of each other roughly according to their average darkness. The whole thing is 188 inches long and printed at more than 250 dpi, so the rendered image is incredibly large &mdash; so large that it surpassed the texture resolution limit for my graphics card, making it too big for my computer <em>to even keep in memory at all</em>. I solved this by splitting it into four separate parts, which also made carrying it around much easier. I consider the result the last of a series that began with <a href="/pages/eyes-through-a-car-window/index.html">Eyes Through A Car Window</a>, but unlike that piece, I wrote the program in Lua.

	Thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laylah_Ali">Laylah Ali</a> and the rest of the Senior Seminar for quality feedback in the making of this piece. This was my final art project at Williams. It took about three months of work.
