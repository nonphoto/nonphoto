Either they're in slow motion, or the whole college is in fast-forward. </p> <img src="/photo-00.7a24e542.jpg" alt="Photo 00"> <img src="/photo-01.b1731d39.jpg" alt="Photo 01"> <img src="/photo-02.4f1bb61e.jpg" alt="Photo 02"> <img src="/photo-03.16757147.jpg" alt="Photo 03"> <img src="/detail-00.1f4f2a09.jpg" alt="Detail 00"> <img src="/detail-01.66f5955e.jpg" alt="Detail 01"> <img src="/detail-02.dea3b575.jpg" alt="Detail 02"> <img src="/detail-03.06493a47.jpg" alt="Detail 03"> <p class="project-description"> The piece is a greyscale print of a computer generated digital image. The program takes a set of drawings, cuts them into vertical slices, and layers the slices on top of each other roughly according to their average darkness. The whole thing is 188 inches long and printed at more than 250 dpi, so the rendered image is incredibly large &mdash; so large that it surpassed the texture resolution limit for my graphics card, making it too big for my computer <em>to even keep in memory at all</em>. I solved this by splitting it into four separate parts, which also made carrying it around much easier. I consider the result the last of a series that began with <a href="/pages/eyes-through-a-car-window/index.html">Eyes Through A Car Window</a>, but unlike that piece, I wrote the program in Lua. </p> <img src="/drawing-00.73ab07b5.jpg" alt="Drawing 00"> <img src="/drawing-01.a07c92cf.jpg" alt="Drawing 01"> <img src="/drawing-02.6fbe1d0c.jpg" alt="Drawing 02"> <img src="/drawing-03.be208ef3.jpg" alt="Drawing 03"> <img src="/drawing-04.ef8293cb.jpg" alt="Drawing 04"> <img src="/drawing-05.7d084ead.jpg" alt="Drawing 05"> <img src="/drawing-06.a648ad46.jpg" alt="Drawing 06"> <img src="/drawing-07.86da10b3.jpg" alt="Drawing 07"> <img src="/drawing-08.40757b88.jpg" alt="Drawing 08"> <img src="/drawing-09.b6fc89cf.jpg" alt="Drawing 09"> <img src="/drawing-10.8bb4fba4.jpg" alt="Drawing 10"> </body> </html>
