The scenes that they appear in are entirely imaginary. Normally when I draw I always have full control over the outcome of the final drawing. Offloading a share of that control to a computer creates a similar tension to the one found between nature and architecture. I think it also makes the prints feel a little uncanny. </p> <img src="/print-00.916bb407.jpg" alt="Print 0"> <img src="/print-01.cc3ceb31.jpg" alt="Print 1"> <img src="/print-02.c37641c3.jpg" alt="Print 2"> <img src="/print-03.15f1c16c.jpg" alt="Print 3"> <img src="/print-04.d0754f5f.jpg" alt="Print 4"> </body> </html>
