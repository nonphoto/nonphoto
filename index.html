    I am a programmer, artist, and designer, fascinated by the beauty in details, computer interfaces, simulations, architecture, nature, loud music, and the unkown.

    This website represents a portfolio of my recent art and design projects. The text is set in Nimbus Sans. The source code (which is still very much a work in progress) is available on my <a href="github.com/nonphoto">Github</a> page.
