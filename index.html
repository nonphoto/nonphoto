<p>
	My name is <b>Jonas Luebbers</b>. I'm a creative engineer at <b>Squarespace</b>, and I graduated from <b>Williams College</b> last year with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Studio Art. I happen to be fascinated by the beauty in computer interfaces, simulations, architecture, exploration, and loud music.

<p>
	My programming projects are heavily influenced by my artwork and vice versa, so this site (an unending work in progress) features a selection of both. Feel free to send me comments, questions, or interesting thoughts by any means you find appropriate.
