<p>
	<b>Jonas Luebbers</b> is a programmer and an artist, fascinated by the beauty in computer interfaces, simulations, architecture, exploration, and loud music. He graduated from <b>Williams College</b> in 2016 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Studio Art. Last year he spent the summer programming at <b>Michael McInturf Architects</b> in Cincinnati, Ohio. He is currently an iOS developer at <b>Mindburner</b> in North Adams, Massachusetts, using technology to change the way we memorize abstract information.

	My programming projects are heavily influenced by my artwork and vice versa, so this site (an unending work in progress) features a selection of both. It is built with Jekyll, a static site generator, and vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The <a href="https://github.com/nonphoto/nonphoto.github.io">source code</a> is publicly available. I'm constantly searching for the next fascinating idea to bring to life, so feel free to send me comments, questions, or interesting thoughts by any means you find appropriate.
