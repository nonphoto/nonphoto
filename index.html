title: About

I'm fascinated by the beauty in details, computer interfaces, simulations, architecture, nature, and loud music. I think of programming as art and design as engineering, with a tendency to disregard my inexperience for the sake of discovery. I graduated from Williams College in 2016 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Studio Art.
