<p>
  I am a programmer, artist, and designer, fascinated by the beauty in details, computer interfaces, simulations, architecture, nature, loud music, and the unkown. I have a tendency to disregard difficulty for the sake of discovery.

  This website represents a portfolio of my recent art and design projects at Williams College and a sample of my professional work. The internet taught me everything I know about web development, so to return the favor the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/nonphoto/nonphoto.github.io">Github</a>.
