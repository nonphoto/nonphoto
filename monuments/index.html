  Technology takes over natural phenomena and repurposes them for further advancement. Materials are harvested and manipulated for the construction of machines and infrastructure, only to be abandoned, left behind to be dissolved back into their surroundings. There is a fascinating complexity to this process, an endless chain of cause and effect that builds objects from nothing and tears them down again.

  The Monument drawings began with a <a href="https://github.com/nonphoto/processing/tree/master/cube_system">Processing sketch</a> that generated random structures, for which I then imagined the context that surrounds them. Since I always tried to increase my control over the outcome of the final product when drawing the surroundings, offloading a share of responsibility for the image to a computer creates the same tension that is found between natural and technological systems.
