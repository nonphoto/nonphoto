<p>
	The Monument drawings began with a <a href="https://github.com/nonphoto/processing/tree/master/cube_system">Processing sketch</a> I wrote to generate random three-dimensional structures. The scenes that they appear in are entirely imaginary.

<p>
	Normally when I draw I always have full control over the outcome of the final drawing. Offloading a share of that control to a computer creates a similar tension to the one found between nature and architecture. I think it also gives the images an uncanny quality, but maybe that's just me.
