description: A series of drawings made from programmatically generated architecture in imaginary landscapes
---

<p class="big">
	The <b>{{ page.title }}</b> series began with a <a href="https://github.com/nonphoto/processing/tree/master/cube_system">Processing sketch</a> that I wrote to generate random three-dimensional structures. The scenes that they appear in are entirely imaginary.	Normally when I draw I always have full control over the outcome of the final drawing. Offloading a share of that control to a computer creates a similar tension to the one found between nature and architecture. I think it also makes the prints feel a little uncanny.
