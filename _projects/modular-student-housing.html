<p>
	Student housing projects are not uncommon in architectural design courses, but this was the most demanding of the two that I had been assigned over the years. Located on the undeveloped bank of the man-made canal that separates the KADK and Danske Filmskole campuses from the freetown of Christiania, the site was not entirely scenic. Even more importantly, each individual suite not only had a maximum size of 5 meters per side, but had to fill the existing pre-built concrete framework. Each of these concrete module slots were built side by side in three rows.

	This project was primarily an exercise in manipulating light and its effect on the atmosphere of the interior space. The space is separated into bright and airy public space above and sleeping quarters below. The upper floor receives a large amount of sun during the afternoon (a necessity during the colder months) which makes the kitchen space, stairway, and balcony more inviting for social events. Vertical slots on the north-east corner provide indirect soft lighting to the bedroom during the morning hours, and a south facing slot has a similar effect for the bathroom and shower in the afternoon. The wall beneath the balcony opens up to the bedroom to let in the better weather in the summer. These two divided spaces are represented on the exterior by a pair of cubes, concrete and wood, whose intersection influences the geometric separation of interior space.
